# FreeCodeCamp Full Stack Certification Projects

This repository contains the projects I'm building as part of completing the newly formalized [freeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).

I originally began working on the certification back in 2022, but with the recent updates and improved structure on freeCodeCamp, I‚Äôve decided to go back through the basics with fresh eyes and greater intention. I'm excited to finish what I started ‚Äî and to **document my progress** every step of the way.

Each folder in this repo links to a separate project, individually tracked with its own Git history using Git submodules. This allows me to keep things clean and modular as I move through each milestone.

## üìÅ Projects

- [`recipe-page`](https://github.com/mjcaldev/recipe-page) ‚Äî A simple and responsive HTML/CSS recipe site
- [`sample-blog`](https://github.com/mjcaldev/sample-blog) ‚Äî A basic static blog layout project
- [`travel-agency`](https://github.com/mjcaldev/travel-agency) ‚Äî A mock travel landing page with more advanced styling
- [`video-comp`](https://github.com/mjcaldev/video-comp) ‚Äî A dynamic video UI component

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Clone This Repo (with Submodules)

If you'd like to explore the code or build it yourself, make sure to clone with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mjcaldev/fccfscert.git
```

Or if you've already cloned it, initialize the submodules like this:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Feel free to follow along as I work through each project, refine my skills, and complete the certification. ‚úåÔ∏è
